# dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles to boost productivity and happiness.

**Note:** Using the `custom` shortcuts will reduce your risk for [Carpal Tunnel Syndrome](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/).

## Getting started

For `oh-my-zsh` users:

- Run `bootstrap.sh` to install these files to `$ZSH_CUSTOM`
- Reload your `.zshrc` to load the new aliases

For `bash` users:

- Run `combine.sh` to generate a `bash_aliases` file
- Move `bash_aliases` to wherever you like
